# Code-Garap

*Note: This project is in the early stages of construction as of late 2023!*

## Description
This project allows for a quick illustration of how a *balungan* (melody) might be interpreted by a Javanese Gamelan. It's main intended use is for educational purposes (for learning about both Javanese Gamelan and C#), but may also serve a use for composers to quickly visualise or find potential issues within a *balungan*.

**Disclaimer: Do not use these parts as a substitute for garap - this program is only a demonstration, and definitely not a replacement for actual interpretation!**

## Features
The program asks the user to input a *balungan* with various details such as the *laras/pathet* (tuning system/mode), and *irama* (tempo/ratio). It outputs a set of parts that represent what some of the central instruments of the Javanese Gamelan would play:
+ Bonang
+ Peking
+ Saron
+ Kenong
+ Kempul

Future features are in development, such as:
+ Using a limited number of kempul for smaller gamelans
+ Transposing the user-defined *balungan* into different a different *laras* and *pathet*
+ Moving from a console application to a web application

## How to use
*(under construction)*
