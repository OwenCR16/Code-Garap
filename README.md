# Code-Garap

*Note: This project is in the early stages of construction as of late 2023!*

## Description
This project is an illustration of how a *balungan* (melody) might be interpreted by a Javanese Gamelan through the use of code. It's main intended use is for educational purposes (for learning about both Javanese Gamelan and the C# language), but may also serve a use for composers to quickly visualise or find potential issues within a *balungan*.

**Disclaimer: This program only serves as a demonstration. It does not provide a replacement for a real player's *garap* (interpretation), which contains a level of depth that lies outside the scope of said demonstration.**

## Features
The program asks the user to input a *balungan* with various details such as the *laras/pathet* (tuning system/mode), and *irama* (tempo/ratio). It generates a set of parts that represent what some of the common instruments of the Javanese Gamelan would play:
+ Bonang
+ Peking
+ Saron
+ Kenong
+ Kempul

Other features include:
+ Transposition of the user-defined *balungan* into different a different *laras* and *pathet*
+ The display of specific parts from either irama

Future features are in development, such as:
+ Using a limited number of kempul for smaller gamelans
+ Using alternative bonang patterns
+ Moving from a console application to a web application

## How to use
