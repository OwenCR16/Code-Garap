# Code-Garap

*Note: This project is in the early stages of construction as of late 2023!*

## Description
This project illustrates through code how a *balungan* (melody) might be interpreted by a Javanese Gamelan. It is mainly intended for educational purposes (to learn about both Javanese Gamelan and the C# language), but may also serve a use for composers who want to quickly realise a *balungan's* interpretation, or find potential issues.

**Disclaimer: This program only serves as a demonstration. It does not provide a replacement for a real player's *garap* (interpretation), which contains a level of depth that lies outside the scope of said demonstration.**

## Features
The program asks the user to input a *balungan* with various details such as the *laras/pathet* (tuning system/mode), and *irama* (tempo/ratio). It generates a set of parts that represent what some of the common instruments of the Javanese Gamelan would play:
+ Bonang
+ Peking
+ Saron
+ Kenong
+ Kempul

Other features include:
+ Transposition of the user-defined *balungan* into different a different *laras* and/or *pathet*
+ The display of specific parts from either irama

More features are in development, such as:
+ Using a limited number of kempul for smaller gamelans
+ Using alternative bonang patterns
+ Using different colotomic structures (currently the application interprets everything as a *ladrang* or similar)
+ Moving from a console application to a web application

## How to use
